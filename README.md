# 🍽️ Simple HTML Recipe Website

This is a basic recipe website built using **HTML only**, showcasing three delicious recipes: Lasagna, Butter Chicken, and Chana Masala. The project was created as part of my learning journey into HTML and web development.

## 📄 About the Project

The website demonstrates the use of fundamental HTML tags such as:

- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Images (`<img>`)
- Anchor (`<a>`)

Each recipe includes:

- A title and image of the finished dish  
- A short description of the dish  
- A list of ingredients  
- Step-by-step cooking instructions  

## 📂 Files Included

- `index.html` – The main page with all three recipes
- `images/` – A folder containing free-to-use images of the dishes (if applicable)
- `recipes/` – A folder containing all the other html files 
- `README.md` – This file

## 💡 How to View the Website

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. Scroll to explore the recipes.

## 🌱 What I Learned

- Designing a multi-section page using only HTML

## 📚 Future Improvements
